# OpenSoar

The OpenSoar python library is meant to provide open source tooling for glider flight analysis. This may vary from 
thermal detection to competition scoring.

# Reading in files with aerofiles

OpenSoar only performs analyses after the files have been read in. The [aerofiles library](https://github.com/Turbo87/aerofiles) provides the functionality
to read the files.

# Plan
A lot of functionality regarding analysis and competition scoring is currently present in the
[PySoar](https://github.com/GliderGeek/PySoar) project. It is the aim to take these functionalities, generalize them
and bundle them in this library.
